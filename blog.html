        <h2>06/03/2018: The Not-So-Trivial Experiences of a Trivia Enthusiast</h2>
        <br>
        <p>One of the most important things I believe in is the value of being a lifelong learner. Not only does it broaden our horizons, but it also gives us a drive to accomplish more. Part of what inspired me to begin blogging was the opportunity it’d give me to share new things I learn regularly—holding me accountable to actively synthesize new information I come across. In the near future, I hope to have a collection of posts up, highlighting interesting takeaways from anything between my coursework, leisure readings, or life experiences.</p>
        <br>
        <p>What sparked my aspirations to be a lifelong learner? Quiz bowl.</p>
        <br>
        <p>For those who are unfamiliar, quiz bowl is an academic trivia game. Popular variants include Reach for the Top, University Challenge, and History Bowl. The gist of the game is to buzz-in and answer questions for your team on a variety of subjects with high speed and accuracy. Topics range from science, to humanities, to fine arts. I was extensively involved with quiz bowl in high school and it was a wonderful experience.</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Wow, that sounds like blind memorization of useless facts.</i></p>
       	<br>
        <p>I’ve heard this many times, and I can see where you’re coming from. It’s true that there can be quite a bit of memorization when preparing for a tournament, and that’s certainly not meaningful learning. But hear me out on why I think there’s a lot more to quiz bowl.</p>
        <br>
        <p>First off, I’ve never liked referring to quiz bowl as trivia, because I don’t think the content is at all trivial. There are other games that may ask “what’s the height of Mount Kilimanjaro?” or “when was the element seaborgium discovered?”, and knowing their answers probably won’t enrich your life in any way. But quiz bowl is not built on your ability to recall specific numbers, somebody’s middle name, or some wild world records. Instead, questions are usually several sentences long, and laid out in a pyramid structure, beginning with lesser known clues and building towards a big giveaway. A question on the Paris Peace Conference might reference the resulting decades of tumultuous Middle Eastern geopolitics and German perceptions of a <i>diktat</i> before finishing off with “name this diplomatic gathering that saw the signing of the Treaty of Versailles”. In this way, quiz bowl encourages a much deeper level of learning. When studying up on famous wars or notable literary works, you will invariably be sucked into reading more about the historical implications of an event, or the stylistic markers of an art movement. This is what I appreciate the most about the quiz bowl community—when someone buzzes in, you know that they’ve poured in hours their own time to really understand a topic. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Personally, I delved a lot into Tudor England from studying medieval history for tournaments. I’d known about Henry VIII’s infamous divorce and how it caused a religious reformation, but it was in-depth reading that revealed how the establishment of the Church of England also served as a way for King Henry to consolidate his power in a recently war-torn kingdom. This revealed interesting parallels between Henry VIII and the 20th century autocrats in terms of their usage of religion to acquire and maintain power—an insight I probably would’ve never gained had it not been for quiz bowl.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The point is, I think one of the greatest things about quiz bowl is the self-motivation it develops. It certainly prompted me to look for learning opportunities in all aspects of my life, be it picking up a new software framework, language, or even a piano piece.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Finally, while quiz bowl taught me an important lesson, I won’t deny a large part of my love for the game is simply because…<b>it’s fun!</b> So give it a try if you ever get the chance, there’s no comparison to the rush of adrenaline when a speedy press of a buzzer clutches a win for your team!</p>
