				<h1>Blog</h1>
				<br>
				<p>I've never tried my hand at blogging before, but I'd like to make a point of using this space to share my thoughts or interesting tidbits I learned. Expect some descriptions of programming projects, 'today-I-learned's, and reflections on readings or past experiences.</p>

					<h3>A Year of GitHub</h3>
					<p class="blog-date-stamp">July 16, 2018</p>
					<p>A year ago, I joined GitHub. It’s not really an important anniversary, but in a way, it marks approximately one year since I started learning to code seriously. Git is one of the things I've been so glad to learn about in the past year, so I’ll be going over some of my personal version control milestones in this blog post. <a href="blog.html#a-year-of-github">Continue...</a></p>

					<h3>My First ASP.NET Web App</h3>
					<p class="blog-date-stamp">June 27, 2018</p>
					<p>A little while ago, I created my first web app using C# and the ASP.NET framework. In this blog post, I’ll discuss my inspiration, development process, and future goals for this app. Note that this will be a more technical post.</p>
					<br>
					<p>At the end of April, I started as a Software Engineering Intern at SPS Commerce, a company whose development stack is predominantly Microsoft-based. Having only completed first-year computer science courses in C and Racket, I knew there would be a steep learning curve. Despite this, I was very excited to dive into coding. In my first week, I familiarized myself with object-oriented programming  (OOP) and worked through several C# and .NET tutorials. Soon, my attention turned to ASP.NET - something my team works with extensively. ASP.NET is a server-side web framework that is part of the broader .NET framework. It uses IIS as web server and supports several programming models. Up until my internship, the only web development I’ve done was on static HTML and CSS pages, so the backend was a daunting new frontier I needed to tackle. <a href="blog.html#my-first-aspnet-web-app">Continue...</a></p>

					<h3>Dear Bayview IB Class of 2018: Reflections of a Grad, One Year Later</h3>
					<p class="blog-date-stamp">June 25, 2018</p>
					<p><em>This post contains my reflections about IB, a high school program that I completed at Bayview Secondary School. It is written as an open letter to this year’s graduating students, and in the spirit of this, I did not include explanations for some of the terms used. However, there is a quick glossary on the lingo at the end of this post.</em></p>
					<div class="inner">
						<hr>
					</div>	
					<p>Congratulations, you made it.</p>
					<p>A year later, I can still recall the sense of relief and feelings of joy when I walked out of my final exam. Many of you are probably more than ready to put IB behind you, as you look ahead to travelling in your extended summer, or going on to post-secondary studies in the fall. Relish these few months to be carefree, you’ve earned it. <a href="blog.html#dear-bayview-ib-class-of-2018-reflections-of-a-grad-one-year-later">Continue...</a></p>

					<h3>The Not-So-Trivial Experiences of a Trivia Enthusiast</h3>
					<p class="blog-date-stamp">March 6, 2018</p>
					<p>One of the most important things I believe in is the value of being a lifelong learner. Not only does it broaden our horizons, but it also gives us a drive to accomplish more. Part of what inspired me to begin blogging was the opportunity it’d give me to share new things I learn regularly—holding me accountable to actively synthesize new information I come across. In the near future, I hope to have a collection of posts up, highlighting interesting takeaways from anything between my coursework, leisure readings, or life experiences.</p>
					<p>What sparked my aspirations to be a lifelong learner? <a href="blog.html#the-not-son-trivial-experiences-of-a-trivia-enthusiast">Continue...</a></p>
